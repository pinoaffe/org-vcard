   ‘org-vcard’ is a package for exporting and importing vCards

(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)' Org mode (http://orgmode.org/).

1 Features
**********

   • _Backwards-compatible with org-contacts.el._

     ‘org-vcard’ comes with a built-in contacts style called ‘flat’,
     which adheres to org-contacts' method of structuring contacts and
     contact information.  It not only supports the properties specified
     in org-contacts.el, but many other properties as well.

   • _Basic support for vCard 4.0, 3.0 and 2.1._

     ‘org-vcard’ is working towards full compliance with the vCard 4.0
     (RFC 6350 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350)), 3.0 (RFC 2426
     (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2426) and RFC 4770
     (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4770)) and 2.1
     (https://web.archive.org/web/20120501162958/http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcard-21.doc)
     specifications.

   • _New contacts style: ‘tree’._

     ‘org-vcard’ introduces a new style for Org contacts, called ‘tree’.
     More details *note below: The tree contacts style.

   • _Highly customisable, via Emacs' ‘customize’ interface._

     Modify existing contact styles; change the labels used to map
     contact details in ‘org-mode’ to various vCard properties/types, or
     add new ones.  Create completely new contact styles by plugging in
     your own code to handle export and import.

2 Installation
**************

Install ‘org-vcard’ from MELPA (http://melpa.org/#/org-vcard), MELPA
Stable (http://stable.melpa.org/#/org-vcard), or put the ‘org-vcard’
folder in your load-path and do a ‘(require 'org-vcard)’.

3 Usage
*******

The main user commands are ‘org-vcard-export’ and ‘org-vcard-import’,
which are intended to be called interactively; you can press TAB at many
of the minibuffer prompts to get a list of the available options for a
prompt.

   Both ‘org-vcard-export’ and ‘org-vcard-import’ are wrappers around
the ‘org-vcard-transfer-helper’ function.  ‘org-vcard-transfer-helper’
can be used to export and import programmatically (i.e. via Emacs Lisp).

   Enabling ‘org-vcard-mode’ will add an "Org-vCard" menu to the menu
bar, from which one can access the various export, import and
customisation options.

   *Note!*  When exporting to vCard using the source ‘buffer’, narrowing
is respected.  If you wish to export the entire buffer without
restriction, remove any narrowing in effect.

   For a list of the properties available by default for each contacts
style and related vCard versions, visit the "Org Vcard Styles Languages
Mappings" setting in the Org Vcard customize group, or examine the value
of the ‘org-vcard--styles-languages-mappings’ variable.

   *Note!*  The default mappings might need to be tweaked for particular
use-cases.  For example, some systems create vCards with a bare ‘TEL’
property, whereas others use ‘TEL;TYPE=voice’; but both are mapped to
the Org ‘PHONE’ property (for ‘flat’ style) or ‘phone’ FIELDTYPE (for
‘tree’ style).  In this case, the ‘customize’ interface could be used to
delete whichever of the two mappings is unwanted.

   The value of the ‘org-vcard-include-import-unknowns’ (boolean)
variable specifies whether the import process should include vCard
properties not listed in the mapping being used.

   The value of the ‘org-vcard-append-to-existing-import-buffer’ and
‘org-vcard-append-to-existing-export-buffer’ (boolean) variables specify
whether the import/export process should append to any existing
import/export buffer.  If not, a new import/export buffer is created for
each import/export.

3.1 The ‘tree’ contacts style
=============================

The structure of the ‘tree’ contacts style is:

     * [Contact name]
     :PROPERTIES:
     :KIND: individual
     :FIELDTYPE: name
     :END:
     ** [Information type]
     *** [Information value]
     :PROPERTIES:
     :FIELDTYPE: [Field type]
     [:PREFERRED:]
     :END:

   Here's an example:

     * Joan Smith
     :PROPERTIES:
     :KIND: individual
     :FIELDTYPE: name
     :END:
     ** Mobile
     *** 0000 999 999
     :PROPERTIES:
     :FIELDTYPE: cell
     :END:
     ** Email
     *** Work
     **** address1@hidden
     :PROPERTIES:
     :FIELDTYPE: email-work
     :PREFERRED:
     :END:
     *** Home
     **** address2@hidden
     :PROPERTIES:
     :FIELDTYPE: email-home
     :END:

   As the ‘tree’ style uses a heading's FIELDTYPE property to associate
fields with their data, the above hierarchy is only one way to structure
contacts; equivalently, one could do:

     * People
     ** Joan Smith
     :PROPERTIES:
     :KIND: individual
     :FIELDTYPE: name
     :END:
     *** Cell
     **** 0000 999 999
     :PROPERTIES:
     :FIELDTYPE: cell
     :END:
     *** Email
     **** address1@hidden
     :PROPERTIES:
     :FIELDTYPE: email-work
     :PREFERRED:
     :END:
     **** address2@hidden
     :PROPERTIES:
     :FIELDTYPE: email-home
     :END:
